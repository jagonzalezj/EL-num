         Numodis coupling with finite element code ELMER using the superposition principle
======================================================================================================

In this version, numodis itself is compiled from scratch in the build directory of the coupling.
As a consequence, it does not require priori compilation of numodis and is therefore more convenient
for development and debugging.

Here are the steps to build this coupling driver:

- create a build directory:     [numodis4elmer] mkdir build

- go into this build directory: [numodis4elmer] cd build

- prepare compilation:          [build] cmake .. -DNUMODIS_DIR=[ABSOLUTE PATH TO NUMODIS] -DELMER_DIR=[ABSOLUTE PATH TO ELMER]

- compile:                      [build] make

This should produce a file called libNumodisCoupling.so located in this build directory. You may
then use this file:

- by copying it in the input directory of your calculation

or

- by setting appropriate link by setting the environment variable PATH2LIBNUMODISCOUPLING
  [...]  export PATH2LIBNUMODISCOUPLING = PATH_TO_THIS_BUILD_DIRECTORY

  or

  [...]  setenv PATH2LIBNUMODISCOUPLING [ABSOLUTE PATH TO YOUR numodis4elmer/build DIRECTORY]

  depending, of course, on your shell.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In this example, Intel's MKL is the default version of LAPACK. You may nevertheless
specify any version of LAPACK by using the following pre-compilation command:

	[build] cmake .. -DNUMODIS_DIR=[ABSOLUTE PATH TO NUMODIS] -DELMER_DIR=[ABSOLUTE PATH TO ELMER]
	                 -DUSE_MKL=OFF -DLAPACKHOME=[ABSOLUTE PATH TO LAPACK]
